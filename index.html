                <p>
                    My name is Jungmin Ahn, a Masters of Engineering student studying
                    Operations Research and Information Engineering, specifically in
                    the Data Analytics concentration. Prior to coming here, I studied
                    Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Washington's
                    Seattle campus, where I took the Data Science track and took part in
                    the Research Honors program.

                    I have always had a strong interest in mathematics and computer
                    programs, so discovering the rise of big data in today's world was
                    an integral part of my choice of pursuing Data Science and Analytics.
                    I am a keen learner, currently specializing in using statistical
                    programming and querying languages and software such as Python, SQL
                    and R to develop visualizations and models to be able to translate
                    intimidating datasets with millions of rows into stories that anyone
                    can read and learn from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am honored to have worked with many incredible faculty members and
                    teammates in countless projects over my academic career, which have
                    helped me gain a great amount of understanding in how wide the scope
                    of data analytics is and why it is such a powerful, popular skill to
                    master in today's world.
                </p>

                    Besides constantly working on my analytical programming skills every
                    day, I also enjoy watching sports (particularly the NFL, MLB, and 
                    European soccer), reading about sports and playing table tennis.

                        My goal is to always be a better person than I was yesterday,
                        every day!

                        <p class="desc">
                            We developed a k-means clustering model that assigns customers to clusters
                            based on their historical purchasing habits to help the marketing managers
                            of some of E&J Gallo Winery's best-selling brands determine how to advertise
                            to their customers for effective customer retention.

                        <p class="desc">
                            We worked with the Cornell baseball team's coaching staff to create scouting
                            reports on opponent batters to identify which pitch types/locations and counts
                            that they are weakest in; I volunteered to do extra work with the pitching coach to
                            create a pitcher dashboard that highlights which pitch types that opponent pitchers
                            tend to employ during games.
