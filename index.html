                    My name is Jungmin Ahn, a Master of Engineering student studying
                    Operations Research and Information Engineering, specifically in
                    the Data Analytics concentration. Prior to coming here, I studied
                    Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Washington's
                    Seattle campus, where I took the Data Science track and took part in
                    the Research Honors program.
                    <br><br>
                    I have always had a strong interest in mathematics and computer
                    programs, so discovering the rise of big data in today's world was
                    an integral part of my choice of pursuing Data Science and Analytics.
                    I am a keen learner, currently specializing in using statistical
                    programming and querying languages and software such as Python, SQL
                    and R to develop visualizations and models to be able to translate
                    intimidating datasets with millions of rows into stories that anyone
                    can read and learn from.
                    <br><br>
                    I am honored to have worked with many incredible faculty members and
                    teammates in countless projects over my academic career, which have
                    helped me gain a great amount of understanding in how wide the scope
                    of data analytics is and why it is such a powerful, popular skill to
                    master in today's world.

                    Besides constantly working on my analytical programming skills every
                    day, I also enjoy watching sports (particularly the NFL, MLB, and 
                    European soccer), reading about sports and playing table tennis.

                        My goal is to always be a better person than I was yesterday,
                        every day!

                            The team developed a k-means clustering model that assigns customers to clusters
                            based on their historical purchasing habits to help the marketing managers
                            of some of E&J Gallo Winery's best-selling brands determine how to advertise
                            to their customers for effective customer retention.
                            <br><br>
                            The team focused on the customer characteristics of the top 3
                            brands-- Barefoot, High Noon and New Amsterdam-- in order to show that the
                            model is able to output unique, "personalized" customer cluster
                            assignments to cater to each brand. We will be presenting our findings to senior
                            members of the E&J Gallo Winery team on May 7th.

                            The team scraped data from Synergy and Trackman to write scouting reports on 
                            opponent batters, highlighting their tendencies on when they swing at
                            and how often they put the ball in play against certain pitch types,
                            pitch locations and counts.
                            <br><br>
                            I volunteered to put in extra work and created a pitcher dashboard that
                            describes how often opponent pitchers utilize certain pitch types against
                            batter handedness and first pitch/2 strike situations; our work has helped
                            the Cornell baseball team earn their first Ivy League Tournament appearance
                            since 2012.

                            The team developed an ML model powered by random forest and neural networks
                            to improve on King County Metro's existing linear system of predicting bus
                            arrival times, going beyond simple bus location tracking by considering a
                            wide variety of factors such as traffic conditions, speed, bus line and
                            number of passengers expected to load and unload at the next stop.
                            <br><br>
                            We also connected our model to King County Metro's official API that outputs
                            live statistics of every bus currently running in the King County Metro system.
                            Training on historical bus arrival data has resulted in our model being able
                            to predict arrivals with a mean error of 2 minutes.
